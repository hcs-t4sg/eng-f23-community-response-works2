          Community Response Works (CRW) is a US-based nonprofit that builds
          infrastructure for the future of community crisis response. To
          safeguard communities from police violence and help people reimagine
          community safety altogether, CRW is building The PATCH Network: an
          unprecedented, nationwide network of mobile crisis teams, health and
          social services, and abolitionist organizations responding to crises
          with care, not violence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The PATCH Network is accompanied by Patch, a dispatching app for
          community-based crisis response teams that serves as an alternative to
          911 and helps mobile crisis teams, healthcare and social service
          providers, and abolitionist organizations quickly provide critical care
          to neighbors in need.
